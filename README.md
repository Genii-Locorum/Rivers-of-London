Foundry VTT implementation for Chaosium's Rivers Of London RPG.

This is a fan made implementation of the River's of London RPG, it is neither supported or endorsed by Chaosium Inc. It provides the sheets and system to run Rivers of London on Foundry Virtual Table Top.

To the best of my knowledge this project does not include any materials from the official books and you will have to enter manually the weapons, skills, items, etc… to be able to play. The implementation provides the functionality to create and use your own skills, spells etc. Go to www.chaosium.com to buy your copy of the rules.

This implementation requires you to install (separately) socketlib by Manuel Vögele which is licensed under MIT.

I started this implementation with the Boilerplate system by Asacolips and used their tutorials plus the Youtube series by Cédric Hauteville.
